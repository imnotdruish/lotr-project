# Lord of the Rings Info Page

This was a project using React and Vite to create a Web page that uses "The One API" page to display Lord of the Rings information across the movies, books, and characters. 

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## What I learned

The project was an interesting step into React and Vite Frameworks, along with a simple API configuraiton. In working with React, I was able to configure multiple pages to import to allow each section to have its own page. In addition, I worked with async functions for creating the fetch for the data. It was a fun experience and look forward to taking what I have learned from this project and creating something new.
